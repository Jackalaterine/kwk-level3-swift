# Lab Notes: Arrays

## Learning Goals

* Students will explain what an array is why they are useful
* Students will create arrays and modify values within arrays
* Students will iterate over arrays

## Plan

During this lesson, you will practice creating arrays. You will also practice accessing, adding, and removing information from arrays.

### Getting Started

* On your laptop, find the Xcode application by typing `cmd + space`, typing in `xcode`, then press return
* Click `Get started with a playground`
* Select 'blank', then click the blue `Next` in the bottom right corner
* You will be prompted to save this file. The default name is `MyPlayground` - let's change that to "Arrays", then click the blue `Create` button in the bottom right corner

### Arrays

Arrays are useful when you need to keep track of related data. If you were tracking the temperature of your hometown over the course of seven days in order to find the average temperature that week, would you write the daily high on whatever random scrap of paper you found every day? Or would you be sure to keep this collection of data together, in the same spot on _one_ piece of paper, so that you could easily determine the average at the end of the week? Arrays are a away to kep track of a collection of data.

#### Expected

* Hobbies array
- Create an array of your top five favorite hobbies
- Change the values within the array
- Add a new hobby to the array
- Remove the second hobby from the array
- Identify the value of the third element of the array
- You should have five hobbies in your array. Using a `for in` loop and string interpolation, iterate over the values in your array in order to print five strings that say "I love \(your hobby here)" 

#### Extension

There are several ways to add, remove, and modify values in an array. There are also a variety of other ways to iterate over values. Using Google/Swift documentation, find a different way to do each of the following:

- add an element
- remove an element
- modify an element
- iterate over values

## Circle Back

As we close our tutorial time, we'll answer the following questions in our journals, leaving time to discuss our answers as a group

- What is an array (in Swift)? Why is it useful?
- We talked about how writing out a grocery list and a list to keep track of temperatures are some real life ways we group and track data. What is another real-life example of arrays? 
- How might some of your favorite apps (Snap, Instagram, etc) use arrays to keep track of data?
