# Lab Notes: Actions & Outlets

## Learning Goals

* Students will establish outlets to manage data in an application
* Students will establish actions to respond to user events


## Plan

You are going to build a single page app that asks a user 2-4 questions and provides some feedback on submission. Like a lot of our labs, you can be as creative as you'd like with what you build!


### Getting Started

* On your laptop, find the Xcode application by typing `cmd + space`, typing in `xcode`, then press return
* Click `Create a new Xcode project`
* Under `Choose a template for your new project`, select `iOS`
* Under `Application`, select `Single View App`
* Click the blue `Next` button in the bottom right corner
* You will be prompted to save this file. For `Product Name`, type in "ActionsAndOutlets", then click the blue `Create` button in the bottom right corner


### Actions & Outlets

Actions are functions that are connected to a UI Object. Most often, we will connect buttons to actions that we want to be fired when the button is tapped.

Outlets are variables that store information - sometimes used to keep track of user input, sometimes used to change the text that appears on the screen.


#### Expected

* Build an app that:
- Takes at least 2 user inputs
- Has some sort of 'Submit' button
- Provides a custom alert to the user when the button is tapped

#### Extension

Use the Date Object from the Object Library - figure out how to format the string that is provided to write the time in a more readable format such as "8:30 am".


## Circle Back

As we close our tutorial time, we'll either write in our journals or discuss as a group:

- In Xcode, how do you create an action? Be as descriptive as possible - pretend you are writing a tutorial for someone who has never done this.
- What is the difference between an action and an outlet?
- Provide at least one example of a common/good use for an action and for an outlet.
