# Lab Notes: Plan Your Design

## Goals

* Students will create wireframes for their ViewFinder App
* Students will write user stories
* Students will consider what built-in iOS icons they plan to use
* Students will decide on naming for actions and outlets


## Plan

Today we will spend about 45 minutes planning our design for our application. While we have a similar end point since we will be building this as a class, each group can put their own flavor into this! You can creative freedom over the details of the 'flow' of your app, icons, text on buttons, etc.


### Getting Started

You'll want to have the following items available:
  * Pen/pencil
  * 5+ sheets of iPad planning paper (you can always get more!)
  * User story sheets
  * If you have a phone of your own, you might want it out to get inspiration from other apps!
  * white boards/markers


### Plan Your Design

Planning - writing user stories and creating wireframes - is 100% just as important as the actual code we write to build an app. It helps us make sure we have a strong vision for our app so that once we start coding, we have a clear goal. IRL, companies spend weeks and even months going through this process before they write a single line of code.


#### Expected

* You need three 'Views':
  - Page that shows a small version of each picture
  - Page where you can view a close-up of a selected photo
  - Page where you can click in to take/select a photo and add a caption

* Design a wireframe on the iPad planning paper for you you want each of these to use. Include
  - Sizes of each UI Object
  - Icons for your buttons
  - Which UI Objects need actions/outlets? Come up with names of these actions and outlets.

* Write a list of user stories for every user interaction that will happen in the app.

#### Extension

* Read through [this](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/icons-and-images/system-icons/) and notice the 'Built in Navigation Bar and Toolbar Icons' - do you want to use any of these for your user navigation? Include that in your wireframe. Also, check out the 'next' page (Navigation Bars) for more inspiration!


## Circle Back

As we close our tutorial time, we'll either write in our journals or discuss as a group:

- How was wire-framing helpful for you in preparing to build your app?
- Why is wire-framing and writing user stories an important part of the development process?
- Are there any user stories or parts of your wireframe that you're still unclear about? Explain.
