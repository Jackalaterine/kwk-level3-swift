# Demo Best Practices

---

# What is a Demo?

* If you want to be a software developer, you have to develop your skill in how to demo
* A demo is a way for you to show your application, your ideas, and your proof of concept
* Generally demos are short (5-10 min) and provide your audience a clear idea of what you are building and what technologies you used to create the application

# How do I demo?

* PRACTICE.  PRACTICE.  PRACTICE. 
    * You should practice your presentation multiple times.
    * Use a timer when you practice.
    * Be comfortable with the words you are using.

* You will present your demo to your small group of 3-4 scholars
* Everyone will give feedback:
    * One thing I liked about your demo was...
    * One thing you can continue to improve is...
