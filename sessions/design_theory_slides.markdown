# Design Theory

^ This is a teacher-talk heavy class as is; feel free to add in CFUs, Turn-and-Talks as you go. This isn't an _essential_ to the curriculum, but we wanted the girls to have some exposure to UX/UI principles now that they have some experience developing small apps from KWK 1&2. The most important outcome of this lesson will be having it to refer to as they are building wireframes and UIs - in their process and potential feedback you provide them with.

# Learning Goals

* Students will be able to identify when Gestalt Principles are and are not being applied in websites/apps.

# Gestalt Psychology

Gestalt Psychology is a concept used to describe how we perceive the world around us as **complete units and patterns** rather than a series of unrelated parts.

"Gestalt" means "shape" or "form", which is fitting as these principals describe the ways in which humans are hard-wired to see patterns and apply structures to quickly understand their surroundings

# The Whole is Greater than the Sum of its Parts

![inline](slide_images/gestalt-example.png)

^ Gestalt suggests that the whole is, in fact, different (and greater) that the individual parts that make it up. Based on this belief, a set of "laws" were written to explain how smaller objects group together to form larger, more significant objects. While these laws do not result in good design by themselves, they are important to keep in mind when designing highly usable and clear websites/apps for users.

# Gestalt Principles

The Gestalt psychologists developed **7** laws, or principals, to explain the way smaller objects are organized and grouped to form larger, complete objects.

These principals can be thought of as mental shortcuts for visual problem solving.

---

# Principle 1: Law of Figure-Ground

Figure is _positive space_ (or the object itself, like a tree) and Ground is the _negative space_ (the space behind the object, like the sky).

![inline](slide_images/figure-ground.png)

^ A figure shall be perceived as separate from it's background.
---

# Principle 2: Law of Simplicity

Items will be organized as "good" (symmetrical, simple, smooth, and regular) as possible.

^ This appears to be two overlapping circles, not a combination of two crescents

---

# Principle 3: Law of Proximity

Elements next to each other tend to be grouped together.

![inline](slide_images/proximity.png)

^ Even though this is made up of unrelated elements, we see a column on the left, a square to the upper right, and a short row on the lower right

---

# Principle 4: Law of Enclosure

Figure is _positive space_ (or the object itself, like a tree) and Ground is the _negative space_ (the space behind the object, like the sky).

![inline](slide_images/enclosure.png)

^ A figure shall be perceived as separate from it's background.
---

# Principle 5: Law of Continuation

Objects aligned on a path are viewed as moving in an implied direction. We continue to follow contours when the elements have established a pattern of direction.

![inline](slide_images/continuation.png)

^ The eye follows the full path implied by each line to see a complete circle

---

# Principle 6: Law of Closure

Contours and gaps in a figure will be seen as completed contours

![inline](slide_images/closure.png)
![inline](slide_images/closure2.png)

^ There are no triangles or circles in this visual, but we are able to fill the missing space to complete these familiar shapes

---

# Principle 7: Law of Similarity

Elements that look similar will be perceived as part of the same form

![inline](slide_images/similarity.png)

^ Despite the similar scale and distribution of shapes, we see columns of squares and circles

---

# Law of Similarity in Action

By using consistent size, spacing, and alignment, we see this group of icons as a complete set of options to choose from rather than unrelated elements.

---

# Law of Enclosure in Action

This examples shows several levels of enclosure, which all help to clarify and streamline how we read and understand this content.

![inline](slide_images/enclosure-example.png)

---

# Law of Continuation in Action

The dotted line that shows us the walking route to a destination is understood to be a continuous line leading us somewhere, rather than a simple assortment of circles.

![inline](slide_images/continuation-example.png)

---

# Another Law of Continuation in Action

Another example of this is the status bar of a media player. The accent color is perceived to represent how far the track has progressed, and the neutral color is seen as the amount of time left on the track.

![inline](slide_images/continuation-example2.png)

---

# Law of Proximity in Action

We can see that the avatar, user name, and display name are grouped closely together. This helps us read this information as a group of related and connected objects. It also separates the user details from the secondary information that described number of tweets and followers.

# Your Turn

In small groups, find the following:

- 2-3 examples of Gestalt Principals being used in digital products or websites that you use regularly. Which laws are being applied? How do these principals make understanding the information easier?
- 1-2 examples where using Gestalt Principals would add clarity and legibility. Which law would you use? How would it make the content more organized and understandable?
