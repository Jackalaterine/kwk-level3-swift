# Lab Notes: Displaying Photos

## Learning Goals

* Students will use an action to allow user to select a photo from camera or library
* Students will use an outlet to update an image view with a selected photo


## Plan

Give the instructor a 1-2 sentence overarching explanation of this lesson


### Getting Started

* On your laptop, find the Xcode application by typing `cmd + space`, typing in `xcode`, then press return
* Click `Create a new Xcode project`
* Under `Choose a template for your new project`, select `iOS`
* Under `Application`, select `Single View App`
* Click the blue `Next` button in the bottom right corner
* You will be prompted to save this file. For `Product Name`, type in "DisplayPhotos", then click the blue `Create` button in the bottom right corner


### Displaying Photos

Info on topic - maybe some background/rationale that was on the slides from class


#### Expected

* Create a brand-new app that ...
  - Has 1 button (it can either access camera, library, or albums - you choose!)
  - Has a placeholder image where you want the selected image to appear
  - Will allow user to tap button, select an image, then see that image in place of placeholder


#### Extension

* Add a button for another way to access photos
* Replace the text of both buttons with icons that are clear to a user as to what they would do


## Circle Back

As we close our tutorial time, we'll either write in our journals or discuss as a group:

- Provide some guiding questions to reflect on - should be a mix of technical and a reflection on challenges/how are you navigating bugs/what is your problem solving like, etc.
