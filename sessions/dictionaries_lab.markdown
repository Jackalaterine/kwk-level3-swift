# Lab Notes: Dictionaries

## Learning Goals

* Students will explain the different between a dictionary and array
* Students will explain situations where a dictionary would be better (than an array) for a situation, and vice versa
* Students will create dictionaries, and access, add, and remove items from dictionaries

## Plan

During this lesson you will practice creating dictionaries, and accessing, adding, and removing information from dictionaries.


### Getting Started

* Provide directions for any set up needed
* Some common ones - open an XCode Playground, Project, or get on your iPad Swift Playgrounds App.

### Dictionaries

Dictionaries, like arrays, hold many pieces of data, which is necessary for us to have. Some data doesn't need to be ordered; rather associated with a title. In this case, it's best to use dictionaries. If you are going shopping and need 4 avocados and 2 jars of salsa, would you write 'avocado, avocado, avocado, avocado, salsa, salsa'? Or would you write something like 'Avocado - 4, Salsa - 2'? I would go with the second option. That's an example of an associative relationship. The order of avocados/salsa doesn't matter, as long as I get 4 avocados and 2 jars of salsa.

#### Expected

* This should be a set of activities that kids need to do to practice/ eventually demonstrate they have this concept down.

#### Extension

* Create a dictionary in which the values are arrays of strings. This is called a _nested_ collection, because it has collections inside of a collection.
* Need ideas for topics? Keys: dogs, cats, dinosaurs. Values: ["German Shepard", "Shih-Tzu", "Great Dane"], etc.


## Circle Back

As we close our tutorial time, we'll either write in our journals or discuss as a group:

- What is a dictionary (in Swift)?
- What's a situation in which you would want to use a dictionary instead of an array? Why?
- What do you still want to know about dictionaries and/or what are you still confused about?
