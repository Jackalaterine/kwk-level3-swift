# Lab Notes: Dictionaries

## Learning Goals

* Students will explain the different between a dictionary and array
* Students will explain situations where a dictionary would be better (than an array) for a situation, and vice versa
* Students will create dictionaries, and access, add, and remove items from dictionaries

## Plan

During this lesson you will practice creating dictionaries, and accessing, adding, and removing information from dictionaries.


### Getting Started

* On your laptop, start the Xcode application by pressing `cmd + space` to bring up the spotlight window, typing in `xcode`, and then pressing return
* Click `Get started with a playground`
* Select 'blank', then click the blue `Next` in the bottom right corner
* You will be prompted to save this file. The default name is `MyPlayground` - let's change that to "Dictionaries", then click the blue `Create` button in the bottom right corner

### Dictionaries

Dictionaries, like arrays, hold many pieces of data, which is necessary for us to have. Some data doesn't need to be ordered; rather associated with a title. In this case, it's best to use dictionaries. If you are going shopping and need 4 avocados and 2 jars of salsa, would you write 'avocado, avocado, avocado, avocado, salsa, salsa'? Or would you write something like 'Avocado - 4, Salsa - 2'? I would go with the second option. That's an example of an associative relationship. We don't care if we buy avocados first or salsa first, as long as we get 4 avocados and 2 jars of salsa.

#### Expected

* Friend/Family Tree
  - Create a dictionary with keys that are family or friend titles (i.e. "sister", "bestFriend") and values that are the name of that family member or friend. Pets are family, too!
  - Aim to have at least 10 family members of friends in your 'tree'
  - Print to the console the entire dictionary
  - Print to the console 3 individual names
  - Remove someone from your tree  ðŸ˜” (You can add them back if you want!)

#### Extension

* Create a dictionary in which the keys are strings and the values are arrays of strings. This is called a _nested_ collection, because it has collections inside of a collection.
* Need ideas for topics?
  - Re-write your family tree with arrays (it's ok to only have 1 item in some arrays). This will make keeping track of cousins easier in some cases!
  - Keys: dogs, cats, dinosaurs. Values: ["German Shepard", "Shih-Tzu", "Great Dane"], etc.


## Circle Back

As we close our tutorial time, we'll either write in our journals or discuss as a group:

- What is a dictionary (in Swift)?
- What's a situation in which you would want to use a dictionary instead of an array? Why And what about vice versa?
- What do you still want to know about dictionaries and/or what are you still confused about?
