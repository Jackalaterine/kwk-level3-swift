# Xcode Intro

---

# What is Xcode?

* A software development tool created by Apple

* It is specifically for developers working on macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS applications

* There are two main features - Playgrounds and Projects

---

# Playgrounds

* A safe place to play around with code and see what happens!
* Solve practice problems to learn the language
* Not for building projects

^ Model: Open up a playground (explicitly walk through every step of opening Xcode, selecting playground, giving it a name). Show the console drawer and emphasize the value shown on right-hand side at each line of code. Also show the top status bar (first place you want to work if you expect a change but aren't seeing it - most likely there will be a spinning wheel).

---

# Playgrounds Lab

Take ten minutes to practice creating a new playground, then:

* Create three variables - your name, age, and favorite thing to do during the summer
* Print to the console a sentence that uses all three of your variables

* Finish early? Print the same sentence out three times, using a loop!

---

# Projects

* A place for building entire iOS projects
* A lot more than writing code goes into building an iOS app, but we do it all in Xcode!
* A LOT of tools - we will take it one step at a time

^ Model: Open up a new project, walk through every step of setup. Show each pane (see one pager) and the buttons to expand/collapse panes. Show file tree and point out storyboard. Model resizing and moving the storyboard. Show simulator, build status bar, and different device views. Add a couple UI Elements and run simulator. Change colors/fonts, then re-run.

---

# Projects Lab

* Use the file tree to navigate to the storyboard
* Add three UI Elements from the Object Library to your storyboard - two labels and a button. switch, or slider
* Run your application on the simulator
* Change the background color of your application
* Change the color or font or size of your UI Elements
* Re-run your application on the simulator - are your changes reflected?
