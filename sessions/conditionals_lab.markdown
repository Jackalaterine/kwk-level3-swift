# Lab Notes: Conditionals

## Learning Goals

* Students will use if/else if statements to control the flow of an application
* Students will use comparison operators


## Plan

This gives practice to students using if/else if/else statements to control the flow of a program.


### Getting Started

* On your laptop, start the Xcode application by pressing `cmd + space` to bring up the spotlight window, typing in `xcode`, and then pressing return
* Click `Get started with a playground`
* Select 'blank', then click the blue `Next` in the bottom right corner
* You will be prompted to save this file. The default name is `MyPlayground` - let's change that to "Conditionals", and then click the blue `Create` button in the bottom right corner


### Conditionals

Flow Control is the idea of controlling where an application goes based on a situation. It's an essential concept to have down as it is used throughout almost every application we use!


#### Expected

* In your playground, create a variable named `favoriteFood` and assign it to a string variable of your favorite food
* Write an `if` statement comparing your favorite to 'Chipotle', which if evaluates to true, prints out a sentence (you choose!)
* Write an `if else` statement comparing your favorite to 'Frappuccino', which if evaluated to true, prints out a sentence (you choose!)
* Write another `if else` - you choose what you compare it to.
* Write an `else` statement that prints out a sentence of your choice
* Try changing your `favoriteFood` to Chipotle, then Frappuccino (if it wasn't already). Do you get what you expected?


#### Extension

* Write a conditional that tells a student if they are in elementary, middle, or high school based on their grade level.


## Circle Back

As we close our tutorial time, we'll either write in our journals or discuss as a group:

- What does the computer do when it sees the keyword `if`?
- What can be used to compare strings and numbers?
- Does `==` care about capitalized letters? Spaces?
- What about writing/reading conditionals can be confusing?
