# Commands & Functions

## Learning Goals

* Students will practice using the Swift Playground tool
* Students will learn to combine a small set of instructions into complex patterns
* Students will practice following the execution of code to find and fix bugs

## Plan

In this session you'll work through a few introductory tutorials in the Swift Playgrounds. You have about one hour of work time.

### Getting Started

* On your iPad, open the "Swift Playgrounds" app
* Click the "Learn to Code 1" box
* Go through the introductory slides

Now you enter the tutorials. Notice on the left side that you'll have instructions and do your programming. On the right is a virtual world where your instructions will get executed.

### Tutorial Work

It's better to move slowly and carefully than to blast through these as quickly as possible. During this session you should complete all the "Expected" tutorials and, if you have time, continue into the "The Big Finish".

#### Expected

* Complete the "Issuing Commands" tutorial where you experiment with `moveForward()` and `collectGem()`
* Complete the "Adding a New Command" tutorial where you add `turnLeft()` to the mix
* Complete the "Toggling a Switch" tutorial to change the world
* Complete "Portal Pracice". Which way did you guess Byte would be facing after teleporting? Were you right?
* Complete "Finding and Fixing Bugs". How do you turn right without a `turnRight()`?
* Complete "Bug Squash Practice". Note that if you click the speedometer icon you can change the speed to "Run Faster". Feeling stuck? Notice that the scoreboard up top is looking for you to collect one gem and have two switches activated.

#### The Big Finish

Get through all the intros? Now try to complete "The Shortest Route" considering these ideas:

* Try working through it by writing a little, testing, then writing a little more.
* Can you use only the `green` teleporter to solve the level in 9 instructions?
* How many does it take to use only the blue teleporter?
* What if you do no teleporting?

## Circle Back

As we close our tutorial time, we'll either write in our journals or discuss as a group:

* What instructions have we learned for Byte? Consider recording these in your notebook and/or on a poster in the classroom.
* What was your most common mistake?
* Did it start to get confusing when there were a lot of instructions? What strategies did you use to understand what you're doing?
* If you could add one instruction for Byte to be able to do, what would it be? Why?
