# Lab Notes: Functions and For Loops

## Learning Goals

* Students will learn to group multiple instructions into a function
* Students will understand the concept of a for loop
* Students will practice mixing functions and for loops to create sequences of movements

## Plan

In this session you'll work through the second set of tutorials in the Swift Playgrounds. You have about one hour of work time.

### Getting Started

* On your iPad, open the "Swift Playgrounds" app
* Click the `* --` in the top left and select `Introduction` under `Functions`
* Go through the introductory slides

*Check Your Understanding*: With your pair, use one of your whiteboards to write pretend instructions for a function `wave_your_hand()`. Think about what you do with your arm, hand, wrist, etc.
