# How to Pair

---

# Programming is Collaborative

^ You might imagine that programming happens alone in cubicles

^ Most programmers work together frequently

^ Pair Programming or "Pairing" is a technique for dealing with the hardest problems

---

# Is this just working together?

* Pairing is different than just working together
* Often working together means "divide and conquer"
* Pairing is two brains working on one problem with a plan

---

# Plans for Pairing

* Step 1 - Defining the Relationship (DTR)
* Step 2 - Work Pattern
* Step 3 - Do the Work!

---

# Defining the Relationship

* Setting expectations
* For a short work period (like 60 minutes), the DTR is probably 2 minutes
* For a long project, the DTR might take more than an hour

---

# DTR Questions

Here are a few questions to discuss with a pair:

* Do you need anything before we get to work?
* Have you solved a problem like this before?
* What do you know about this problem?
* What helps you do your best work?
* What do we consider "success"?

---

# A First DTR

Turn to your partner and try a 5-minute DTR.
You will then work with your partner on our first challenge.

---

# Work Pattern: Driver/Navigator

^ We said that pairing needs a "work pattern". There are several work patterns that can be used in pairing.

* The driver is in charge of the machine -- the iPad/laptop
* The navigator is in charge of the plan -- what do we do next?
* The navigator dictates what code should be entered (the thinking)
* The driver is in charge of typing the code (the doing)
* Each exercise/chunk of work you complete, switch roles

---

# Pairing with Functions & For Loops

It's time to practice your pairing.

* Quickly recap your DTR to make sure you're ready to work
* Once everyone is ready, we'll move on to the next exercise
